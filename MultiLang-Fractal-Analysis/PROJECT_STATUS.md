# Project Status

## What Actually Works

After way too many hours debugging and three failed attempts at getting Docker networking right, here's what I've got running:

### The Basic Stuff (All Working)

**C# Implementation** - This was my starting point
- Crunches through 10,000 market candles in a few seconds
- Spits out CSV files that Excel can actually read
- Works with the old .NET Framework when the new stuff isn't installed
- Fractal dimension calculations are surprisingly consistent

**Go Version** - Turned out better than expected  
- Goroutines make the parallel processing almost trivial
- Memory usage stays reasonable even with large datasets
- Build process is dead simple (love Go's tooling)
- Actually faster than I thought it would be

**C++ Version** - When you need maximum speed
- STL does most of the heavy lifting
- Templates everywhere but compiles down to fast code
- Minimal external dependencies (learned that lesson before)
- Probably overkill for this but was fun to write

**C Version** - Because I got carried away
- Pure mathematical computations, no frameworks
- Will compile on pretty much anything with a C compiler
- Custom hash table implementation for box counting
- Definitely overkill but good for portability

### The Distributed System (Mostly Working)

This is where things got interesting and frustrating in equal measure:

**Kafka Setup** - Streaming thousands of ticks per second
- Market data producer that doesn't fall over under load
- Multiple consumer groups processing different analysis
- Retention policies that don't eat all my disk space

**Spark Cluster** - For the heavy mathematical lifting
- Custom UDFs for fractal dimension calculations
- Distributed processing across multiple workers
- Streaming mode for real-time analysis
- Batch mode for historical backtesting

**HFT Simulation** - The fun part
- Microsecond precision order execution (in theory)
- Portfolio management with actual risk controls
- Pattern recognition that triggers trades
- Realistic slippage and commission modeling

**Monitoring Stack** - Because you need to know when things break
- Grafana dashboards that actually make sense
- Prometheus metrics for everything that moves
- InfluxDB for time series storage
- Nginx reverse proxy (because why expose everything directly)

## What I Learned

1. **Fractal analysis is genuinely useful** - Market roughness changes before big moves
2. **Go's concurrency model is brilliant** - Goroutines just work
3. **Docker networking is still painful** - But once it works, it works
4. **Kafka is overkill for small projects** - But scales beautifully
5. **Real-time systems are hard** - Microsecond precision is aspirational

## Performance Numbers

From my testing on a decent laptop:

- **Single-threaded C**: ~1.2 seconds for 10k candles
- **Multi-threaded Go**: ~1.8 seconds (overhead from goroutines)
- **C++ STL version**: ~1.5 seconds
- **C# LINQ version**: ~2.1 seconds (not bad for managed code)

The distributed system handles ~5000 market ticks/second without breaking a sweat.

## What's Next

If I keep working on this:

1. **Real market data integration** - Get off simulated data
2. **Machine learning layers** - Pattern classification
3. **GPU acceleration** - Because why not
4. **Better error handling** - Current setup is a bit fragile
5. **Proper documentation** - This README doesn't count

## Running the Thing

For the basic analysis:
```bash
run_all.bat  # Runs all 4 language versions
```

For the full distributed setup:
```bash
cd docker-infrastructure
deploy-fractal-system.bat  # Hope Docker is working
```

Then hit http://localhost/ for the dashboards.

## Notes

- Built and tested on Windows 11
- Docker version assumes you have enough RAM (8GB minimum)
- The distributed setup takes ~5 minutes to fully start
- Sometimes Kafka gets grumpy and needs a restart
- Grafana login is admin/fractal2024 (yeah, I know)

The code isn't perfect but it works, and I learned a ton building it.
