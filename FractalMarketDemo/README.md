```

### Alternative Compilation (if dotnet CLI not available)
The project can also be compiled using Visual Studio or any C# compiler that supports .NET 6.0.

## Demo Workflow

The application runs through 7 interactive steps:

1. **Market Data Generation**: Creates 500 data points using fractal-enhanced simulation
2. **Market Events**: Adds volatility clustering and market shocks
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects fractal patterns using box-counting method

5. **Ensemble Predictions**: Generates predictions using 5 different methods
6. **Results Display**: Shows comprehensive analysis with visualizations
7. **Data Export**: Exports all results to timestamped CSV files

## Output Files

The application exports 5 CSV files per session:

- `market_data_[timestamp].csv` - Raw simulated market data
- `fractal_patterns_[timestamp].csv` - Detected fractal patterns  
- `market_behavior_[timestamp].csv` - Market behavior analysis results
- `predictions_[timestamp].csv` - Ensemble prediction results
- `session_summary_[timestamp].csv` - Overall session summary

## Educational Value

This demonstration illustrates:

- How fractal mathematics applies to financial markets
- Box-counting method for measuring complexity
- Self-similarity detection in time series data
- Multi-scale pattern recognition techniques
- Ensemble machine learning approaches
- Volatility clustering and mean reversion concepts

## Customization

Key parameters can be modified in the `FractalMarketDemoApplication` constructor:

```csharp
_dataGenerator = new MarketDataGenerator(
    drift: 0.0002,           // Market drift (trend bias)
    volatility: 0.025,       // Base volatility (2.5%)
    fractalDimension: 1.4    // Fractal dimension (1.0-2.0)
);
```

## Technical Notes

- **Fractal Dimension Range**: Typically 1.1 to 1.9 for market data
- **Pattern Length**: 20 to 100 data points for reliable detection
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.6 minimum for pattern acceptance
